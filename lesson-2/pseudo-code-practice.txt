END
=============================================
A function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together 

casual: 

Given a list of words

Declare a variable that will hold the final resulting string

Iterate over each word concatenating each one to the final result
followed by a space.

return the final result

Formal: 

START

Given an array of strings called words

SET sentence = an empty string ""

FOR EACH element in words keep track of the index you are at.
	IF the index != the end of the words array
		Then concatenate the element to sentence followed by a space " "
	ELSE
		concatenate the element *with out the trailing space*
RETURN setence
================================================
A function that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element 

casual:

Given a list of numbers

Create an empty array to store the result

Iterate over each number skipping over every other element

return the new array

Formal:

START

Given an array of numbers called allNumbers

SET everyOtherNumber = [];

starting at index 0
FOR every index in the allNumbers array 
	IF the (index % 2 === 0)
		push that element to the everyOtherNumber array
	index + 1
		
RETURN everyOtherNumber

END
